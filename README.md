How to run This ? 

 To Run This code properly you have to use a python notebook reader like Jypter Notebook
 or Google Colab.
 
 I am choosing Google Colab as it's free & no need to do complex setup like Jypter Notebook.
 Make sure you have a Google Account !
 
 Link of Google Colab - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18iA0KiNmMmWHEO5X7rVBTpJKwEkFWnes?authuser=0
 
 Open this link and sign in using your existing Google Account.
 Now, openNotebook you can see an Interface like this.

 Go to , Files > Upload Notebook
  
Browse and select your file (.ipynb) to open the notebook.

 Use this "Mount Drive" option to mount google drive or you can manually run this code to 
"Mount Drive' also, 
from google.colab import drive
 drive.mount('/content/drive')

upload the files except ' .ipynb ' file to the path that you have just mounted by using drive or 
you can just drag on drop on this here.

Make sure the path must be same otherwise It will not work. 

Now, you are ready to run the code and start explore my works. 
Thank You.
